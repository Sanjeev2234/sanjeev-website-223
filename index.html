            Dance has been a part of human culture since the very earliest communities and civilisations, with recorded evidence of dancing being found dating back to 30,000 years ago.<br/>

                Here is a list of the most popular types of dance:<br/>
                1. Contemporary<br/>

        <h2 class="head-name">Comtemporary</h2>
        <p class="para-name">
            Developed during the mid-twentieth century, contemporary dance is now one of the most popular and technical forms of dance studied and performed professionally, especially in the US and Europe.
            
            Drawing on classical, modern and jazz dance styles, contemporary dance has evolved to incorporate many characteristics of a broader range of dance forms.
            
            Known for its emphasis on strong torso and legwork, contract and release, fall and recovery and floor work, it is often known for unpredictable and disordered changes in speed and rhythm throughout a performance.
            
            Contemporary dancers therefore require a shock-absorbing surface to protect their feet, legs and ankles from rapid movements and changes in rhythm. Harlequin’s innovative ‘triple sandwich’ Harlequin Activity sprung floor can be paired with several of our vinyl dance floors, to create the ideal surface for contemporary dance.</p>

        <h2 class="head-name">Tap Dancing</h2>
        <p class="para-name">
            Tap dancing is a type of percussive dance characterised by the “tap” of shoes hitting the floor as the person dances. Tap dancers often wear metal “taps” on the heel and toe of a shoe to accentuate the sound.

            Often performed as part of musical theatre, tap dancing often focuses on choreography and formations, with more than one tap dancer performing at once.
            
            Tap dancing characterises a range of dances including flamenco, rhythm, classical, broadway and postmodern tap.</p>

        <h2 class="head-name">Hip-Hop</h2>
        <p class="para-name">
            Hip-hop dancing refers to a range of street dances that developed in relation to hip hop music and culture. Hip-hop dancing dates back to the early 1970s in New York and California, evolving out of Funk and the development of break beat.

            Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles emerging out of these including Memphis Jookin’, Turfing, Jerkin’ and Krumping. These were often popularised and made mainstream after being featured in music videos of the time.

            Today, hip-hop is performed in outdoor spaces, in dance studios and competitively.

            Unlike many competitive dance styles, hip-hop is often improvisational with dance crews challenging each other to dance battles.</p>

        <h2 class="head-name">Folk Dance</h2>
        <p class="para-name">
            Folk dancing is celebrated worldwide with people of different cultures and religions using various forms of folk dance to portray emotions, stories, historical events or even aspects of daily life.

            Some well known types of folk dance include: Bharatanatyam (India), Samba (Brazil) and Hula (Hawaii). Some cultures may even perform multiple variations of folk dances, with countries like South Korea performing individual dances for key events such as victories in war, farming, music and religion.

            Folk dances are commonly held at public events, where people can participate regardless of whether they are professional or complete beginners. Such dances are also accompanied by traditional music to further enhance the cultural experience.</p>
